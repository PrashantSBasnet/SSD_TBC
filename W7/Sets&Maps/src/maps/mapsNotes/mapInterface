Map Interface

# Not a sub interface of Collection Interface. Therefore, behaves differently
# Part of Collection Framework
# Key, Value pair

1. Keys and values are objects, and can be of any data type.
2. Duplicate keys are not allowed. Values can be duplicated.
3. Each key and value pair is called an entry. Hence, map is considered as collection of entry objects.
