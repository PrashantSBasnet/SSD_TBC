All the codes that we have discussed in the class are available in this folder. 

It should cover the basic concepts and lay a foundation to address your lab works. 
However, these are not the complete resources and I strongly recommend you to go through the slides for a thorough and advanced understanding.
You can start with these codes as they are presented in the simplest manner as possible and then jump into the Uni slides for a thorough understanding.
