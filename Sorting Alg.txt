Bubble Sort

 Compare each element with another and swap if the latter is smaller
 Sorted elements are placed towards right
 Ascending order

 LOOP n times 

*************************************************

Selection Sort

Loop 1st
1. First, set minimumIndex =0
2. Next, figure out the index holding min value by iterating through the elements and comparing it with the value at index =0
3. If val at particular index < val at min index swap index and finally the item
4. Sorted Values are towards the left

Loop 2nd
   Repeat by assigning minimumIndex=1 because the value at 1 is the smallest, hence sorted.

Loop 3rd 
   Repeat
   2 items are sorted
...   

Loop n-1
   All elements are sorted except the last one.
   Hence, the last element is already sorted.
   
  
*************************************************
Insertion Sort

LOOP1
Pick the 2nd element and compare with the 1st
If the 2nd element < the 1st element ---> SWAP

LOOP2 
Pick the 3rd element and compare with the 2nd 
if 3rd element<2nd element ---> SWAP else { do nothing }
also if 3rd element<1st element ---> SWAP else { do nothing }

LOOP3 


LOOP (n-1)
Hence, all sorted
