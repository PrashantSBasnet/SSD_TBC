Data Structures are used to store, organize, manage and retrieve data.
Common Operation in Data Structures: 
1. Store 
2. Organize (storing data as per index)
3. Manage (Replace an element, remove an element)
4. Retrieve


Collection is an object that represents a group of objects.

Java Collection Framework
- It provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects

    It can be broken down into 3 sections:

	Interfaces: 
	Abstract types that define the methods available on a collection

	Implementations
	Classes providing logic that completes and satisfies methods defined on collection interfaces

	Algorithm
	Computations like searching and sorting that work with collection types

	--------------

	Benefits of Collections:
	Standard data structures within the programming language deliver tremendous benefits for Java Developers.

	Reduces Effort
	Developers are not required to build or learn custom data structures, saving valuable development time.
	
	Increases Quality
	Implementations are battle tested, giving developers instant access to high-performing and well-engineered data structures.
	
	Promotes Interoperability
	Unrelated code bases are collections in their APIs, which creates interoperability among them.

	Array 
	- fixed size
	- IndexOutOfBound Exception if we want to store more than the size of the array
	- Solution: Collection
