Collection Interfaces are divided into 2 groups 
1. java.util.Collection
2. java.util.Map


java.util.Collection has the following descendants:

1. java.util.Set
2. java.util.SortedSet
3. java.util.NavigableSet
4. java.util.Queue
5. java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue
6. java.util.concurrent.TransferQueue
7. java.util.Deque
8. java.util.concurrent.BlockingDeque


java.util.Map has the following descendants:

1. java.util.SortedMap
2. java.util.NavigableMap
3. java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap
4. java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentNavigableMap


-> Collections that do not support modification operations (such as add, remove and clear) are referred to as unmodifiable. 
   Collections that are not unmodifiable are modifiable.
   
-> Collections that additionally guarantee that no change in the Collection object will be visible are referred to as immutable. 
   Collections that are not immutable are mutable.
   
-> Lists that guarantee that their size remains constant even though the elements can change are referred to as fixed-size. 
   Lists that are not fixed-size are referred to as variable-size.
   
-> Lists that support fast (generally constant time) indexed element access are known as random access lists. 
   Lists that do not support fast indexed element access are known as sequential access lists. 
   The RandomAccess marker interface enables lists to advertise the fact that they support random access. 
   This enables generic algorithms to change their behavior to provide good performance when applied to either random or sequential access lists.
