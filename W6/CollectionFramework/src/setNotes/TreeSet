TreeSet

1. Only Homogeneous insertion
2. Comparisons based on Balanced Tree
3. Underlying Data Structure: Balanced Tree

In Balanced Tree, 
1. Duplicates not allowed
2. Insertion order not preserved
3.								 First element you insert is always root,
  -- value < root value 																--value>root value
4. Null value accepted only when TreeSet is empty. If you try adding value after null, NullPointerException as Tree set
   adds value in sorting order.
   
#5.Any Object stored in TreeSet must implement Comparable Interface
