Hierarchy - List

Collection (I)
		-List (I)
			--ArrayList(C)	--LinkedList(C 		--Vector(C)
														---Stack(C)

List Characteristics:
1. Ordered Collection of elements (ordered means insertion order of element is always preserved w.r.t index)
2. List allows positional access to elements (add, remove via index) 
3. Allows duplicates
4. It is an interface. We cannot create its object. We create its instance using its implementation classes		

-------------------------------------------------

ArrayList (Resizable or growable array)

1. Allows duplicates elements
2. Insertion Order is preserved		
3. Accepts heterogeneous objects

Default size of ArrayList is 10 (0-9 index) //ArrayList al = new ArrayList(); 
- If 10 blocks get occupied, new array list with size of: 
				x * (3/2) +1 =16 [x=size of current array list i.e 10]
- Then, all the elements of old array list gets copied to the new array list. 
- Old array list will be discarded by the garbage collector.



#ArrayList implements Serializable, Cloneable, RandomAccess Interface
RandomAccess Interface allows any random element to be accessed in same speed

# ArrayList and Vector best for retrieval operation frequently on any collection. 
# ArrayList is not recommended for insertion and deletion because for a single insertion or deletion, many shifts of elements of the list occur.
