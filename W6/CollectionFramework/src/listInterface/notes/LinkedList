Linked List 
-Linked List are data structures in which every element consists of (data part and address part)
-Each element of Linked List is called a nodes

Basic Characters: 
1. Allows duplicate elements
2. Insertion Order is preserved
3. Accepts heterogeneous objects
4. Null Insertion is possible


Methods like addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast() are used to develop Stack(LIFO) and Queues(FIFO)


Differences with ArrayList:

ArrayList																
-not recommended for insertion and deletion in middle					
	(because shift of each element)											 
-Best choice for retrieving operations									
	(because consecutive memory locations are only located to arrays.
	 array is the underlying data structure for ArrayList.)
	 

LinkedList
-Best choice for frequent operations of insertion and deletion in middle 
    (because change of address of particular node is sufficient)
-Not recommended for retrieval operations
	(because location/address of an element is only available to the previous element
	 therefore, JVM has to go to every node of Linked List one by one on retrieval)
