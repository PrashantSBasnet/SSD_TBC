Vector implements List

1. Allows duplicates
2. Allows heterogeneous objects
3. Insertion Order is preserved
4. Implements Serializable, Cloneable, RandomAccess Interfaces
#5. Vector are thread-safe. All methods are synchronizable. This means only one thread can access the method at a time.


ArrayList
1. Methods in ArrayList are not Synchronized. Not Thread Safe!
#2. Performance is relatively high as they are not synchronized!
3. Not a Legacy Class.



Vector 
1. Methods in ArrayList are Synchronized. Thread Safe!
#2. Performance is low because threads are required to wait to operate on a Vector object.
3. Legacy Class

Default size of Vector is 10 (0-9 index) //Vector v = new Vector(); 
- If 10 blocks get occupied, new array list with size of: x*2 
- Then, all the elements of old vector gets copied to the new array list. 
- Old Vector will be discarded by the garbage collector.
